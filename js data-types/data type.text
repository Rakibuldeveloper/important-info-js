1 Primitive Data Types:

Number: Represents numeric values, including integers (whole numbers) and decimals.

String: Represents textual data enclosed in quotes (single or double quotes, or backticks).

Array : An array is a special type of object that allows you to store a collection of items under a single variable name.
These items can be of various data types, including other arrays, objects, or even a mix of different types.

Boolean: Represents logical values, either true or false.

Null: Represents the intentional absence of a value.

Undefined: Represents a variable that has been declared but not assigned a value.

Symbol: A unique and immutable data type primarily used as an object property key.

BigInt: An integer data type that allows for arbitrary precision (larger numbers than the standard Number type).

2 Non-Primitive Data Type:

Object: A complex data type that stores collections of key-value pairs. Objects provide a way to structure data and represent real-world entities.
